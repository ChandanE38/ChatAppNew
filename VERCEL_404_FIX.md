# Fixing 404 NOT_FOUND Errors in Vercel Deployments

## Problem Description

When clicking on the project link after deploying to Vercel, you're encountering a 404 NOT_FOUND error with the following details:

```
404: NOT_FOUND
Code: NOT_FOUND
ID: bom1::mm5qv-1757946756385-beae4997d4b0
```

## Root Causes and Solutions

### 1. Build Output Configuration

**Issue**: The build output directory or asset paths may not be correctly configured.

**Solution**:
- Ensure the `distDir` in vercel.json matches your actual build output directory
- Verify that the `build` script in package.json is correctly defined

```json
// In frontend/package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build",
    "vercel-build": "vite build"
  }
}
```

### 2. Base Path Configuration

**Issue**: Vite's base path might not be correctly set for production deployment.

**Solution**: Update your vite.config.js to include the correct base path:

```javascript
// In frontend/vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/', // Ensure base path is set correctly for production
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
    assetsDir: 'assets',
    emptyOutDir: true,
  },
})
```

### 3. Asset References

**Issue**: Assets might be referenced with incorrect paths in your HTML/JS files.

**Solution**: Ensure all assets use absolute paths (starting with `/`) or relative paths that work with your base path configuration.

### 4. Routes Configuration

**Issue**: The routes in vercel.json might not be correctly configured.

**Solution**: Verify your routes configuration in vercel.json:

```json
"routes": [
  {
    "src": "/api/(.*)",
    "dest": "backend/server.js"
  },
  {
    "src": "/uploads/(.*)",
    "dest": "backend/server.js"
  },
  {
    "src": "/(.*)",
    "dest": "frontend/dist/$1"
  }
]
```

### 5. Deployment Cache Issues

**Issue**: Sometimes Vercel caches old deployment configurations.

**Solution**: Try forcing a clean deployment:

1. Delete the `.vercel` directory if it exists in your project
2. Run `vercel --prod` to deploy with a fresh configuration

### 6. Check Deployment Logs

**Issue**: There might be build errors that aren't immediately visible.

**Solution**: Check the deployment logs in the Vercel dashboard for any errors during the build process.

## After Making Changes

1. Rebuild your frontend application: `npm run build` in the frontend directory
2. Redeploy to Vercel: `vercel --prod` from the project root
3. Clear your browser cache before testing the new deployment

## Additional Troubleshooting

If the issue persists after trying the solutions above:

1. Try deploying a simplified version of your application to isolate the problem
2. Check if your application works correctly in development mode
3. Verify that all required environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard
4. Contact Vercel support with the specific error ID for further assistance
